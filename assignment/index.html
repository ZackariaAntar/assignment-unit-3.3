    <!-- create an ordered list with any questions you have on this week's material -->
    <ol>
      <li>Are there any alternatives to using the browser for checking the console logs?<br> Ran into some serious issues with infitie loops/broken code, just want to save myself the headache in the future if possible.</li>
      <li>Not super sure how to word this, but is it possible to preserve the integrity of the originally created array? <br> Wondering if it's possible to revert back to the original array after using the various methods(.sort(), .reverse(), etc...). <br> Or, is it a variables mindfulness kind of thing? </li>
